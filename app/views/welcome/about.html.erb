    <h3>What is Friendface?</h3>
    <p>
      Friendface is a great new site for meeting people.
    </p>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>
      Friendface works along the same principle as a cold or a terrible plague.
      But it's not disgusting germs that Friendface spreads.<br />
      <strong>It's friendship!</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Each Friendface page is like a petri dish filled with friendship germs. When you
      stick your face into the dish, you may come away with millions of other people
      attached to your face.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's right! It's basically a diseased face of friendship! Just sign up
      with Friendface by giving us all of your personal information, and we'll
      provide a webpage where you can:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">meet new friends</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">catch up with old ones</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">and maybe find that special someone!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Don't think about germs now. That analogy's over! Now it's just love and
      companionship, and everything's fine.
    </p>

    <p>
      We own everything you put on Friendface. It says so in the Terms and
      Agreements, but don't worry about that. We won't use it to do anything
      bad. We promise!
    </p>

    <p>
      Just think about love and companionship, and everything's fine.
    </p>

  Katie Atrops<br />
  <small>Lead VCR Engineer</small>
</h2>

<div class="feed">
  <%= image_tag "katie.jpg", class: "img-responsive img-rounded img-small" %>

  <p>
    Katie is the local master of the no-longer-obsolete VCR technology. She creates
    cassettes on a whim, deletes and recreates VCR files at the speed of one hand
    clapping in a forest when no one is around to see it, and has a great sense of
    humor. Before joining the company, she was involved in several top-secret
    missions in and around the Seattle-area. She holds things from time to time and
    with expert ability. In her spare time, she can also sometimes be found grasping
    and clutching things. She is not usually on fire.

  <small>Lead Test Engagement Developer</small>
</h2>
<div class="feed">
  <%= image_tag "victoria.png", class: "img-responsive img-rounded img-small" %>

  <p>
    Victoria is our first set of feet on the ground. She brings light and rainbows
    to the Friendface world and is the first point of contact for every new franchise
    location. Her technical skills are second to none! Without her contributions,
    we never would have harnessed the
    <%= link_to "power of nyan cat", "http://paperjs.org/examples/nyan-rainbow/" %>,
    the power we use to send Friendface messages through the internets. When she's
    not in the office, she enjoys nyan cat racing competitions and leaping into outer
    space to check on her space friends.

   Brenna McNinjaFace<br />
  <small>Inspiration Systems Developer</small>
</h2>

<div class="feed">
  <%= image_tag "brenna.jpg", class: "img-responsive img-rounded img-small" %>

  <p>
    Brenna is someone without whom the team would be lost. Without her, Friendface
    would never have come together in its current form. An integral working part of
    the Friendface machinery! She holds a PhD in Corgi Picture Consumption. In her
    spare time, she enjoys the occasional board game with a side of puppy photos.
    She is a surprisingly quick typist and occasionally beats out the reigning office
    typing champion, Sir Keyeboe R. d'Ninjaface III.

    Dr. Jerry is a key member of the Friendface software development team. Before
    joining the company, she worked on software for robot destructoloids, ravenous
    plant consumption bots, and on many side projects related to attempting to
    summon Cthulhu. She holds a BA in BS from the University of Hogwarts Education
    Reform Society. In her spare time, she enjoys trying on Friendface shirts and
    teaching robots how to hate.
