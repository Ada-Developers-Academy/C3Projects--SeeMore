      <p>
        Katie is the local master of the no-longer-obsolete VCR technology. She creates
        cassettes on a whim, deletes and recreates VCR files at the speed of one hand
        clapping in a forest when no one is around to see it, and has a great sense of
        humor. Before joining the company, she was involved in several top-secret
        missions in and around the Seattle-area. She holds things from time to time and
        with expert ability. In her spare time, she can also sometimes be found holding
        or grasping things.

        When she isn't in the office, she can often be found cracking hilarious jokes
        with the most amazing deadpan expression.

        Brenna is someone without whom the team would be lost. Without her, Friendface

        the Friendface machinery! She holds a PhD in Corgi Picture Consumption. In her
        spare time, she enjoys the occasional board game with a side of puppy photos.
